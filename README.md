# Project-10-Full-Stack-App-with-React-and-Rest-API

### This full stack React app interacts with the project 9 CORS-enabled REST API. 

#### After downloading the code:
* CD to the api folder and run npm install, then npm run seed to install all dependencies and seed the database. Run npm start to start the API server.
* CD to the client folder and run npm install, then npm start to start the client.
* The API runs on localhost:3000 and the client runs on localhost:5000.

This app allows a user to sign up, sign in, sign out, and perform basic CRUD operations on the courses table in the database when authorized.
